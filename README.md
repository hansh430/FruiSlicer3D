# FruiSlicer3D

Fruit Ninja was a popular mobile game released in 2010. In the game, fruit is thrown in the air, and the player must slice it before it hits the ground. In this chapter, youâ€™ll make the Fruit Slicer game, which copies the mechanics of the Fruit Ninja game. Just as exciting, I have program this game using some completely new Scratch features, so get ready!
